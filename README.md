Schachfeld Engine
=================

The Schachfeld-engine is a chess-engine, developped by some members of the Schachfeld-forum. Meant to become semi-strong and fun to play one day. Currently in the early stages of its development.

![Board-representation](docs/pics/schachfeld_winmine_12x12.png)

The engine supports the universal-chess-interface for communication with your favourite GUI. It uses a 12x12-board for calculation and is planned to receive an endgame clown with some funny mating patterns.

How To Download
---------------
[version_0.h.zip](https://github.com/rombelstielzchen/Schachfeld_Engine/raw/refs/heads/main/release/archives/Schachfeld_Engine_0.h.zip) (Windows, 64 Bit)

[Older versions](release/archives)


How to Use
----------
First download the latest zip-archive and extract it, e.g. to your desktop. Then take your favourite graphical chess-program. There should be a menu-item like Menu -> Engines -> Install Engine..., that either opens a custom dialog or directly starts a file-selection-dialog. Here select the *SchachfeldEngine.exe*. If you get asked if the engine supports the UCI-protocol or the WinBoard-protocol, choose UCI. The engine should be now ready to be used. Some GUIs will automatically start the new engine, others will ask you to start the new one. Have fun!

How To Get The Source-Code
--------------------------
* First you need Git, a source-code management system. As a Windows-user you can get it from [https://git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).
* Git comes with two frontends: a graphical user-interface and a console, Git-Bash.
  We use the latter one, which works on other systems too. Open Git-Bash, then change the working-directory at the command-prompt:
  ~~~
  cd Desktop
  ~~~
* Now you can check out the project from Github. At your command-prompt type:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/rombelstielzchen/Schachfeld_Engine
~~~
 Once the download has completed you should see **Schachfeld_Engine** at your desktop, 
 This directory contains the complete Git-database (hidden) and the code of the main development-branch. Enjoy!

How To Build
------------
### On Windows ###
* Get [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/community/) from MicroSoft for free (16.000 diskettes). Install especially the C++ development-tools on the left hand side of the installer.
* Open the file "src/Visual_Studio/Schachfeld_Engine.sln".
* Click Menu -> Build -> Rebuild All.
* The command-line program "schachfeld.exe" should now exist in the folder "src/visual_studio/x64/Release", ready to be used.

### On Linuxoid Systems ###
* Make sure you have the following programs installed: basename, bash, echo, git, g++, ld, make, perl, sed, sort, uniq, xargs, zip. Most of them should be installed per default, don't worry.
* Open a DOS-Fensterle and change the directory to "/home/otto/desktop/schachfeld_engine/src" or whatever the username is, my dear Mr. Otto.
* Run the "make" command.
* Enjoy the "engine" program in your working directory.

The makefile currently supports the following commands:
* make: create a debug-build of the engine, then run the internal tests
* make clean
* make exe: build a Windows executable. This command requires Windows, a Linux-like command-line like Git-Bash and Visual Studio.
* make optimized: planned for the future
* make stats: show project statistics
* make todo: show TODO-comments

How To Geek
-----------
If you are curious, how a chess-engine works under the hood, 
you might just double-click the executable for a first impression. 
The Schachfeld_Engine will then run user-friendly in a black window
and display some instructions.

How To Communicate / Cooperate
------------------------------
We have a development-thread at the legendary Schachfeld-forum: [Einen Namen f&uuml;r das Baby](https://www.schachfeld.de/threads/40956-einen-namen-fuer-das-baby). The forum is mostly German, but our members speak all languages: Italian, Spanish, French, Scotch, Latvian, Catalan. You are welcome!
